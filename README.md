"But I'm on the internet. And when you're on the internet..." -Jason Scott, totally out of context

This is a really bad RAT (Remote Administration Tool(?)) that I'm writing in C# to learn sockets. A few things:

Don't be a dickhead with this code.

If you are a dickhead with this code, there is a very high liklihood that you'll be caught being a dickhead with this code, since there's no encryption

Probably not good to take this as an example of how to do any of the things I'm doing in it; This is my first time with the vast majority of it

To summarise: Don't be a dick. Learn from my mistakes instead.
