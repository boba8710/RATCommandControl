"But I'm on the internet. And when you're on the internet..." -Jason Scott, totally out of context

This is a really bad RAT (Remote Administration Tool(?)) that I'm writing in C# to learn sockets. A few things:

Don't use this code for bad things.

If you use this code for bad things, there is a very high liklihood that you'll be caught using this code for bad things, since there's no encryption

Probably not good to take this as an example of how to do any of the things I'm doing in it; This is my first time with the vast majority of it

To summarise: Don't use this code for bad things. Learn from my mistakes instead.
